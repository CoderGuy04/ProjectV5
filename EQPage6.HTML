Next up is the amygdala. This part of your brain works with the brain stem as your "downstairs brain" area, essentially keeping you safe during times of danger. They control your fight-flight-freeze responses in times when you feel like your life is being threatened, although they can act at the wrong times, leading to things like panicking before a test. Because of this, you need a good way to calm yourself down and reach your "upstairs brain", so you can think things out.
